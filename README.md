# Calculator-Cents

I am a high schol math teacher trying to learn a little codeing and I am creating this calculator.

First goal of the project is to have multiple calculator views and a working financial calculator view.

Long term vision is to have multiple calulator views for differnt uses. 

I did a something similar several summers ago when for the windows phone platform. My son started learning java in school and I decided to do the same :)
